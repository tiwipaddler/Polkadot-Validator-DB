## Installation

To get started with the Polkadot Validator Dashboard, clone the repository and run the installations below
  
```bash
npm i polkadot-api
npx papi add dot -n polkadot
npm run dev
```

## Future Improvements

1. Enhancing the Average APY Metric: Currently, the dashboard provides a snapshot of APY for individual eras. I would like to further refine the calculation of an average APY over a series of eras, providing a more holistic view of validator performance over time.

2. Improving Visualizations: The dashboard could benefit from more advanced visualizations, particularly for displaying validator performance trends over time. Implementing interactive graphs or charts would allow nominators to track changes in performance more effectively.

3. Extending effort to include the project add-ons. This will be a personal project for me now.
